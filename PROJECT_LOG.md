# LouderMe — Project Audit Log

Permanent chronological log for decisions, changes, tests, findings, regressions, pending work, and current status.

## 2026-10-05 — Project initialization

### Change / finding
The project was defined as an Android-first general audio booster, not merely a system volume control.

### Product decision
The primary goal is to increase the phone's general audio output so low-volume media can be heard more loudly. User-facing quick controls include 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, and 200%. Mixer/EQ and predefined mixes are core secondary features. Smart Boost remains experimental and disabled by default.

### Action completed
- Product name selected: **LouderMe**.
- GitHub repository created as `realmichelduarte/LouderMe`.
- Android package fixed as `com.realmichelduarte.louderme`.
- README, proprietary LICENSE, permanent project audit log, architecture notes, project protocol, and About specification prepared.
- Initial Jetpack Compose shell created with boost-level controls, Mixer/EQ entry point, Smart Boost Beta entry point, and About screen.
- Initial version set to `0.1.0`.

### Validation
- Repository naming and package identity reviewed for consistency.
- About reads the version from `BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME` rather than a hard-coded production version.
- No claim of working global amplification has been made.

### Pending
- Prove reliable global audio processing on the target Android/Samsung device.
- Determine the supported system-wide audio-effect path on the target Android version.
- Implement boost engine with limiter/protection.
- Connect 100–200% quick controls to the real audio engine.
- Implement fine boost control, Mixer/EQ, preset persistence, and preset library.
- Implement Smart Boost Beta only after the manual/global path is stable.
- Add automated tests and device validation checklist.
- Produce an installable APK after the audio engine reaches a testable milestone.

### Current status
Foundation release `v0.1.0` prepared. UI shell and project protocol are established; the core global audio engine remains unimplemented and unvalidated.
